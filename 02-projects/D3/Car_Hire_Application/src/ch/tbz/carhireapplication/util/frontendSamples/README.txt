/////////////////// FRONTEND-SAMPLES ///////////////////



|--- Explanation ---|

This package contains classes and enums that help you to simply do inputs and output. The purpose of the package for a
developer is not to make the program run faster, but to keep the code clear and understandable. It will also evolve over
time, so below is a small development log. This package should be like a library, but it is not, because I don't know
how to create one.
